Introduction to HTML 

HTML is used in websites, apps and various software whenever technology is involved, it is basically allowing us to structure our content and bridge the gap between humans and computer languages. 

HTML Syntax  

<p> it is the opening tag 

</p> it is the closing tag 

There is content which is HTML element and is written between opening tag and closing tag. Example <p> HELLO WORLD </p> 

HTML HEADLINES 

The are six levels of headlines; 1st level <h1> content </h1> 

                                                                  2nd level <h2> content </h2> 

                                                                  3rd level <h3> content</h3> 

                                                                   4th level <h4> content </h4> 

                                                                   5th level <h5> content</h5> 

                                                                    6th level <h6> content</h6> 

h1 is Bigger than h2 and h2 is bigger than h3 and this order, h1 serves as the main title and h2 is a subtitle for the content. 

 We use the "<i>" element to apply visual italics and the "<em>" element to add emphasis and elements to make something bold in HTML we use <strong> or <b> 

In conclusion there are four elements in HTML that marks words as bold or italic, and these two (<em> , <strong>) convey meaning and serve a language related purpose. 

And the other two (<i>, <b>) do not have a specific meaning instead they are used for visual styling. 

HTML LISTS 

<ul> is unordered list </ul>, unordered like ingrediants 

<li>flour</li> 

<li>Sunger</li> 

<ol> ordered list </ol>  

<li>in a bowl mix all the dry ingredients</li> 

<li>add sugar and oil</li> 

<li>wait for 5minutes</li>
